# Machine Learning for Urban Morphologies

Repository with complementary material for the paper "A machine learning approach to urban design interventions in non-planned settlements".

This repository includes the python script we used to generate a dataset of images from ArcGIS.
The script cannot be used outside of Arcgis since it uses its API.

See the [full paper](http://papers.cumincad.org/data/works/att/caadria2022_45.pdf) for more details.
